# FUN-Python-Practice
Write a program called fun.py that displays the following pattern. Your program will consist of print statements containing the characters ’F’, ’U’, ’N’, and ’ ’ (space). The output shows that line 1 consists of seven F’s followed by five spaces, a single ’U’ followed by five spaces, one ’U’ followed by five spaces, two ’N’s followed by four spaces, and finally two ’N’s. The remaining lines follow similarly although the number of spaces between characters varies.
