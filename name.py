#Write a program called name.py that asks for a personâ€™s first name, then middle, and then last. It should then greet the person using their full name. Hint: You will need to use variables when writing this program.

first_name = input('Enter first name:')
middle_name = input('Enter middle name:')
last_name = input('Enter last name:')
print(' ')
print(f'Hi {first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}!')
